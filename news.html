                <p class="date1-info">We are sorry to hear that, The 55-year-old man had composed a text message
                    addressed to his brother, in which he gave "all that I have" to his brother and nephew.
                    The message was found in the drafts folder on the man's phone after he took his own life last year .
                    Brisbane Supreme Court ruled that the wording of the text indicated that the man intended it to act
                    as his will.</p>
